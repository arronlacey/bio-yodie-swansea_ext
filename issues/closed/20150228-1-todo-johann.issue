comments: Check out if ;FILE_LOCK=NO;ACCESS_MODE_DATA=r will do what we want.
Also add ;IFEXISTS=TRUE to avoid unnecessary creation of the db. 
resolution: done for all pipelines where I could find a parameter value that contained jdbc:h2. 
Also changed in VectorContextualSimilarityPR.java. H2 was used in StructuralSimilarityPRV2.java
but this is not used any more, and V3 uses the fastgraph instead of H2 tables.
