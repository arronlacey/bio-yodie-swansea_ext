  Think about how to package up some of the basic 
  tasks we perform into an API. Ultimately this could be a wrapper around 
  using our own REST service or something faster. This could simplify experiments
  and evaluation because we do not have to create separate pipelines for everything
  and instead just write a fast Groovy/Scala script.
