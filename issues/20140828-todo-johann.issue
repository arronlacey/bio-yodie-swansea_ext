  Like in the Spotlight paper, select a random sample of known to be ambigous
  WP links for simple and quick experiments. Other than them we probably cannot
  easily do holdout but only in-training set selection but on the plus side,
  if we do this right, we could maybe select our evaluation set also based 
  on ambiguity, type of target resource etc.
