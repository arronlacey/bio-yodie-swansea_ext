comments: We have mentioned this as still missing research in the www15 paper but did 
not address or discuss it: can we, for a given tweet, retrieve all the other tweets that
preceded and came after that tweet in a "thread"  or "conversation"? So not just timeline
tweets but tweets where one user answered another.
