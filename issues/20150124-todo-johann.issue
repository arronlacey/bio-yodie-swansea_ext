priority: 3/10
comments: The Twitter corpora we have now are not imported from the twitter
json format and therefore all information about entities etc. is missing, retweets
are truncated, URLs are sometimes truncated etc. 
Check if we can re-fetch the tweets based on tweet id and copy over the key annotations
based on text matching.
