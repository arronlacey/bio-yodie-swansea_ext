WE HAVE TWO VERY WEIRD BUGS HERE:

1) differences when running the same pipeline on the same document

For the documents in directory debug1 we see the following
= we run main.xgapp which creates set Shef
= we move Shef to Ref using pipeline trasferShef2Ref
= after that a single annotation is present in Ref which should not be 
  there and is never there when we just run main.xgapp
  
It is even weirder: transferShef2Ref has the following steps:
= delete set Ref
= either of the following: 
  a) copy Shef to Ref, then remove all but Key, Ref and Shef
  b) copy Shef to Ref, then remove all but Key and Ref (i.e. also remove Shef)
  c) transfer Shef to Ref, then remove all but Key and Ref

After the, using version a) the output is correct, i.e. the annotation is NOT there.
Running b) or c) the output is incorrect, the annotation is there.

This seems to be 100% repeatable. never seen it the other way around!!


2) Nullpointer exception in AnnotationSetImpl when evaluating:

It seems that an annotation set has been created which does not have a document stored!
