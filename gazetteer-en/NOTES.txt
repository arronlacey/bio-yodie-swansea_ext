IMPORTANT: we need to re-think the way how the country demonyms and adjectivals
  are annotated and used. 
  At the moment, the misc-en gazetteer just produces Lookup annotations which are 
  later used to look up the underlying string in the labelinfo db
However: 
  if the Lookup is coextensive with a lookup from the gazetteer-en, we will get
  two identical lookupList annotations with identical candidates
  If the Lookup is not coextensive, how can we expect to get any candidates?
  Also, what should a candidate really look like?

We need to do this differently: essentially we have the following possible situations
  = the two are coextensive and the URI of the misc-en gaz is in the candidate list
    we get from label info: in that case we do not need the misc-en match at all
  = the two are coextensive and the URI is not in the candidate list: then the label
    for that URI is not found during preparation, and we should add the label to 
    that URI during preparation. However the label is present in preparation for 
    other URIs, therefore we get the coextensive annotations
  = there is no coextensive lookup, so the country annotation is the only one.
    In that case too, the label is missing from the preparation phase and we 
    should just add a "synthetic"  label/URI pair
 
One other issue is that demonyms may not be labeled as NNP by the pos tagger,
so we should not filter by pos tag!

For now we do filter by POS tag (but see ideas about how to use ANNIE/Stanford
NER and other things to filter less strictly) so this is actually the only 
case where our lookups are now useful:
  if it is a lookup from misc, do not filter by postag before doing 
  the lookup, but before doing the lookup, filter coextensive ones!!
